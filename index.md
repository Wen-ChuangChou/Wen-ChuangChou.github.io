### Speaker Identification


I utilized the transformer encoder to identify speakers in a dataset of 56,666 voice recordings.  The accuracy rate for correctly identifying speakers is 77.24%. For more details, please refer to my [Github](https://github.com/Wen-ChuangChou/Speaker-identification) repository.

### Anime Face Generator
I used approximately 71,000 samples of anime faces to teach the computer how to draw anime faces in the Japanese style. By implementing a diffusion probabilistic model, I trained generative networks specifically for generating anime faces.  
Here are some samples of generated anime faces after 1000(left) and 20,000(rigth) training iterations, respectively:
