### Anime Face Generator
I used approximately 71,000 samples of anime faces to teach the computer how to draw anime faces in the Japanese style. By implementing a diffusion probabilistic model, I trained generative networks specifically for generating anime faces.  
Here are some samples of generated anime faces after 1000(left) and 20,000(rigth) training iterations, respectively:
