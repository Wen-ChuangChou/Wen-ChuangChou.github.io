## Selected Recent Projects in Machine Learning  

### Sentiment Analysis  
I fine-tuned the Llama 3 model for sentiment analysis, improving accuracy from 63.41% to 81.49%. This demonstrates the effectiveness of model adaptation for domain-specific NLP tasks. The radar plot below visualizes the enhanced performance across various metrics.

### Predicting Bike Traffic  
I implemented Graph Attention Networks to predict bike traffic volume using social and environmental data. The models were trained separately on datasets from Dresden, Leipzig, and Hamburg. The following plot illustrates the results across the three cities:

### Speaker Identification  
I developed a speaker identification system using Transformer and Conformer encoders, improving accuracy from 53.94% to 91.8% on a validation dataset of 56,666 voice recordings. More details are available on [GitHub](https://wen-chuangchou.github.io/Speaker-identification/).

### Anime Face Generator  
Using a dataset of approximately 71,000 anime face images, I trained a diffusion probabilistic model to generate anime-style portraits. The generative network improved significantly over training iterations, as shown in the images below:  
After 1,000 iterations (top) vs. 20,000 iterations (bottom):
