### Sentiment Analysis
My final model, <b>fine-tuned</b> for sentiment analysis using Llama 3, achieves an accuracy of 81.49%, marking an improvement of over 18% compared to the base model. The radar plot below illustrates the enhanced performance across various metrics.

### Predicting Bike Traffic  
I implemented <b>Graph Attention Networks</b> to predict bike traffic volume using social and environmental data. The models were trained separately on datasets from Dresden, Leipzig, and Hamburg. The following plot illustrates the results across the three cities:

### Speaker Identification  
I developed a speaker identification system using <b>Transformer and Conformer encoders</b>, improving accuracy from 53.94% to 91.8% on a validation dataset of 56,666 voice recordings. More details are available on [GitHub](https://wen-chuangchou.github.io/Speaker-identification/).

### Anime Face Generator  
Using a dataset of approximately 71,000 anime face images, I trained a <b>diffusion probabilistic model</b> to generate anime-style portraits. The generative network improved significantly over training iterations, as shown in the images below:  

After 1,000 iterations (left) vs. 20,000 iterations (right):
