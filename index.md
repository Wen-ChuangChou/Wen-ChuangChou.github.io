### Predicting Bike Traffic  

I implemented Graph Neural Networks to predict the volume of bike traffic using features derived from social and environmental data. The data from Dresden, Leipzig, and Hamburg were used individually to train the networks. The following plot illustrates the results obtained from models trained on the three cities:

The project won the second prize in the data science challenge at BTW 2023. For more details, please refer to my [Github](https://wen-chuangchou.github.io/Predict-Bike-Traffic/) page.

### Speaker Identification


I utilized the conformer encoder to identify speakers in a dataset of 56,666 voice recordings.  The accuracy rate for correctly identifying speakers in validate dataset is 91.8%. For more details, please refer to my [GitHub](https://wen-chuangchou.github.io/Speaker-identification/) page.

### Anime Face Generator
I used approximately 71,000 samples of anime faces to teach the computer how to draw anime faces in the Japanese style. By implementing a diffusion probabilistic model, I trained generative networks specifically for generating anime faces.  
Here are some samples of generated anime faces after 1000 (upper) and 20,000 (lower) training iterations, respectively:
